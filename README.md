# Intro to Forecasting Redux

This repository contains updates to Dr. Joel Fingerman's forecasting and time series textbook manuscripts, recreated in Tufte-themed R markdown. The updates also correct various minor errors and add missing graphs to fille in the "figure x" blank place holders. In addition, I add some content and a few additional graphs for clarity and reorder some sections. These updates, along with the clarity of Tufte, should aid learners more clearly understanding the material.

## Sections Completed

[Introduction to Time Series](https://github.com/JustinMShea/forecasting/blob/master/Tufte-Manuscripts/Chapter-6-New.pdf).

This section covers an introduction to time series graphing techniques, smoothing, and classical time series decomposition.
