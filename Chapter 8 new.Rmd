We now examine another area of time series forecasting similar to weighted moving
averages, called _exponential smoothing methods_. One of the major distinctions between regressions methods on time series data and smoothing methods is that regressions give equal weight to all of the sample data whereas smoothing methods give decreasing weight to older, more distant data.

##Single Exponential Smoothing

A popular, widely used time series smoothing and forecasting method is _single exponential smoothing_ (also called _one-parameter exponential smoothing_). Exponential smoothing is a form of weighted moving average in that recent observations carry more weight than older observations.

Exponential smoothing is based on the concept that a new, one step-ahead forecast can be determined from the _previous forecast_ and the _error of the previous forecast_. We illustrate this concept below. 

Suppose we have the following series:

```{r, message=FALSE, error=FALSE, comment=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
 # Import data from table 6.2 text file
Table_62_path <- path.expand("~/R/forecasting/Table 6.2.txt")
table_62 <- read.delim(Table_62_path, header = FALSE, sep = " ", skip = 1)
 # add column names
colnames(table_62) <- c("Period", "Actual", "Period", "Actual")

# First, gather the time series data table into one column.
library(tidyr)
table_62_series <- gather(table_62[,c(2,4)])
table_62_series$key<- as.numeric(rownames(table_62_series))
table_62_series$forecast <- ""
colnames(table_62_series) <- c("Period", "Actual", "Forecast")

kable(table_62_series[1:3,], align = 'l', col.names = c("Period", "Actual($Y_t$)","Forecast"))
```

And, suppose a one-step ahead forecast for period 4, made at period 3, is 352.5^[$$\hat{Y_3}(1) = 352.5$$].

```{r, message=FALSE, error=FALSE, comment=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
table_2 <- table_62_series[1:4,]
table_2[4,2:3] <- c("NA", 352.5)
kable(table_2, align = 'l', col.names = c("Period", "Actual($Y_t$)","Forecast"))
```

Then suppose period 4's actual value is 389.


```{r, message=FALSE, error=FALSE, comment=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
table_3 <- table_2
table_3[4,2] <- 389
kable(table_3, align = 'l', col.names = c("Period", "Actual($Y_t$)","Forecast"))
```


So, the forecast error is 36.5.

$$\varepsilon_{3}(1) = Y_4 - \hat{Y}_3(1)$$
$$36.5 = 389 - 352.5$$

\newpage

In otherwords, we _underforecast_ by 36.5.

```{r, message=FALSE, error=FALSE, comment=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
table_4 <- table_3
table_4$Error <- ""
table_4[4,4] <- 36.5
kable(table_4, align = 'l', col.names = c("Period", "Actual($Y_t$)","Forecast", "Error"))
```

Since we underforecasted, we will adjust upward our next forecast, based on the error of our previous forecast.  We adjust our next forecast upward by 20% of the forecast error. $20\%$ of $36.5$ is $7.3$.

Hence, the forecast for period 5 is the old forecast of 352.5 adjusted upwarded by
7.3. 
$$352.5 + 7.3 = 359.8$$
$$\hat{Y}_4(1) = 359.8$$

```{r, message=FALSE, error=FALSE, comment=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
table_5 <- table_4
table_5[5,] <- c(5,"NA", 359.8, "NA")
kable(table_5, align = 'l', col.names = c("Period", "Actual($Y_t$)","Forecast", "Error"))
```

The actual value for period 5 is 350, so the one-step ahead period 5 forecast error
is
 
$$\varepsilon_{4}(1) = Y_5 - \hat{Y}_4(1)$$
$$-9.8 = 350 - 359.8$$

In otherwords, we _overforecast_ by 9.8.

```{r, message=FALSE, error=FALSE, comment=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
table_6 <- table_4
table_6[5,] <- c(5,350, 359.8, 9.8)
kable(table_6, align = 'l', col.names = c("Period", "Actual($Y_t$)","Forecast", "Error"))
```

The forecast for period 5 then is adjusted by 20% of the forecast error, $20\%$ of $-9.8$ is $-1.96$.

The Forecast for period 6 is:
$$359.8 + (-1.96) = 357.8$$
$$\hat{Y}_5(1) = 357.8$$

Each new forecast, $\hat{Y}_t(1)$, is based on the preceding forecast, $\hat{Y}_{t-1}(1)$, plus an adjustment for forecast error.

If we denote the adjustment factor by $\alpha$, we have:

 $$\hat{Y}_t(1) = \hat{Y}_{t-1}(1)+\alpha\varepsilon_{t-1}(1)$$

Algebraically, we re-arrange the last equation as the formal representation of _exponential smoothing_.


##Single Exponential Smoothing, one-step exponential smoothing^[Formal Notation, equation 8.1]

```{marginfigure}
**$$\hat{Y}_t(1) = \alpha Y_t + (1-\alpha) \hat{Y}_{t-1}(1)$$**
```

 In the case of $\alpha$ = 0.2, we have 
 
$$\hat{Y}_t(1) = 0.2 Y_t + 0.8  \hat{Y}_{t-1}(1)$$

The new forecast is the weighted average of the current observation $Y_t$ and the previous forecast $\hat{Y}_{t-1}$.
  
Returning to equation 8.1 displayed in the right margin, we illustrate why this approach is called _exponential smoothing_. Since

$$\hat{Y}_t(1) = \alpha Y_t + (1-\alpha) \hat{Y}_{t-1}(1)$$,

we shift back by one period^[Equation 8.2]

$$\hat{Y}_{t-1}(1) = \alpha Y_{t-1} + (1-\alpha) \hat{Y}_{t-2}(1)$$

by substituting equation 8.2 in for $\hat{Y}_t(1)$ in equation 8.1 we have

$$\hat{Y}_t(1) = \alpha Y_t + (1-\alpha) \left(\alpha Y_{t-1} + (1-\alpha) \hat{Y}_{t-2}(1)\right)$$,
